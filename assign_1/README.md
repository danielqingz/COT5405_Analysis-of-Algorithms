**Problem 1**: Weighted approximate common substring. 

Given two input strings, not necessarily of the same length, based on alphanumeric characters [A-Z], determine the best common substring. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string, and the score that determines the best substring is defined as the sum of the weights  for each character in the sequence (i.e. ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?w_A) is the weight of matching letter A) and a penalty ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\delta) for each mismatch (negative penalty term to drive down the score). In your experiments, consider situations in which ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?w_l=1) and ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\delta=10) and in which ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?w_l) is proportional to the frequency of the letter in English and ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\delta) takes values between the smallest and the largest weight (multiple experiments for 10 intermediate values). Note: you are now allowed to add gaps in the solution, i.e. both matched substring have the same length. 

**Problem 2**: Interval-based constant best approximation. 

Given a set of $N$ points ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?(x_i,y_i)) with integer values for ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x_i) between 1 and M and real values for ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?y_i),  find a partitioning of the interval ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?[1,M]) into contiguous intervals such that the error of approximating points in each interval element by the average value of ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?y) in the interval is minimized. You need to add a penalty factor proportional to the total number of intervals the solution has.
