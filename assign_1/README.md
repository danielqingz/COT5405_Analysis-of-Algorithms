Problem 1: Cycle finding
As part of this problem, you have to design and implement an algorithm to find a cycle (just one cycle) in an undirected graph.

Problem 2:  Minimum Spanning Tree for "sparse" graphs
For this problem, we consider undirected graphs that have n nodes and at most n+8 edges. For these graphs, you have to design an efficient algorithm that finds the minimum spanning tree.
